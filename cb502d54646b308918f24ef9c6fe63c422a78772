      "message": "This is the same method that was created in the prior review. This may be a recurring pattern as you resolve the Sonar items.\n\nSince this test was written, we have added some useful utilities in helpers.py, utils/*, and structure.py\n\nRather than repeat the definition of the same method, I would recommend re-writing methods written in this method to use structures.py\u0027s Heat class.\n\nExample:\n\nheat \u003d Heat(yaml_file)\nfor r_id, props in heat.nova_server_resources:\n    # then the logic of the check\n\nThis will simplify the overall method and address the Sonar fix without duplicating any code.",
