I would suggest something that better reflects the action being performed (ex: get_network_flavor)\n\nI would also not suggest accepting cls as a parameter as only one class can be passed.  You can just pass the parameter.  Since this method will only work with ContrailV2NetworkFlavorBaseProcessor, then I\u0027d suggest changing it to a classmethod\n\n@classmethod\ndef get_network_format(cls, param):\n   # rest stays the same\n\nThen when you call the method you will change it to \n\nself.get_network_format(param)",
